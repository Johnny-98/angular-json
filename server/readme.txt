To create a microservice that processes the data from your data.json
 and returns it in response to HTTP requests, we can use Node.js and Express. 
This microservice will expose an endpoint to fetch property 
details based on a query parameter. Here's a basic implementation:


//2
Main Server (index.js): This file is for your main Express server, handling endpoints like /data and /search, and managing the socket connections.

Microservice (server.js): This separate file is specifically for the microservice that handles the /property-details endpoint. The search logic I 
provided should go into this file. This microservice runs independently from your main server, ideally on a different port.

Yes, you should run both the server and the microservice for your application to function correctly. Here's why and how:

Server (Main Backend): This is your primary backend server, possibly handling tasks like user authentication, serving other types of data, and managing socket connections. It is essential for the overall functionality of your application.

Microservice (Property Details Service): This is a separate, standalone service specifically designed to handle property details. It operates independently of your main backend server.

To run both:

For the Server:

Navigate to the directory containing your main server's code.
Run the server using a command like node server.js or npm start, depending on how you've set it up.
Ensure it's listening on the correct port (e.g., localhost:3000).
For the Microservice:

Navigate to the directory containing your microservice's code.
Start the microservice using a similar command (node server.js or npm start).
Make sure it's running on a different port from your main server (e.g., localhost:4000).
Both services need to be running simultaneously because:

Your Angular frontend will be making requests to your main server for some operations.
It will also make requests to the microservice for property details.
If they are not running concurrently, your application might not work as intended, and some features may not be available. Make sure your Angular service is pointing to the correct URLs for both the server and the microservice.


//cors
The error you are encountering is due to the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy. When your Angular app (running on http://127.0.0.1:4200) 
tries to make a request to your microservice (running on http://localhost:4000), it is blocked because these are considered different origins, and 
the microservice does not explicitly allow such cross-origin requests.

To resolve this issue, you need to enable CORS in your microservice. This can be done by setting the appropriate headers in the responses from your 
microservice or by using the cors package, just like you did in your main Express application.
